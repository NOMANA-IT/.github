### Franck Blettner / Founder of Nomana-IT
With over two decades of dedicated experience in JD Edwards, I have cultivated a deep expertise, acquired extensive knowledge, and established a robust network of partners within the integration ecosystem surrounding this ERP platform. Throughout this journey, I've honed my skills in crafting intricate architectures, seamless interfaces, leveraging cutting-edge technologies, and ensuring robust security measures. Among my notable achievements is the development of a comprehensive management tool tailored to enhance the security and compliance of Oracle licenses, showcasing my commitment to innovation and excellence in the field.
